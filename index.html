        <p class = "intro">Intern and Incoming Developer Analyst at <em><strong><a href="https://www.dtcc.com/" target="_blank">Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation</a></strong></em></p>

        <p class = "intro">
          I am a Senior at Stevens Institute of Technology. I am studying Computer Engineering
          with an emphasis on Programming. I have knowledge in C++, Python, Java and Web Development.
          I have 3 internships of experience in IT, and I have accepted a full-time offer at DTCC as
          an analyst coming July 2020. I play tennis and basketball, but have a love for most sports.
          I enjoy traveling and exercising, but enjoy mental challenges such as chess and board games.
          I live in New Jersey and enjoy spending time with friends and family. I play cards with my
          aunt and uncle every Saturday.
